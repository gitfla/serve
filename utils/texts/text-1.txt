The feminist movement has a rich history marked by significant milestones. In the 19th century, activists fought tirelessly for women’s right to vote. The early 20th century saw landmark achievements like the passage of suffrage laws in many countries. Post-World War II, feminism shifted focus to workplace rights and reproductive freedom. The 1960s and 1970s sparked the rise of second-wave feminism, emphasizing social and cultural inequalities. Later, the third wave introduced ideas of identity and diversity. Each era responded to its unique social challenges and pushed the movement forward. Feminism’s legacy includes legal reforms and cultural shifts worldwide. Despite progress, gender disparities remain in many spheres. Understanding this history helps inform today’s ongoing struggles for equality.
