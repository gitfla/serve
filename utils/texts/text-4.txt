Media plays a powerful role in shaping perceptions of gender and feminism. Historically, women have been underrepresented or stereotyped in film, TV, and advertising. These portrayals reinforce harmful myths about womenâ€™s roles and capabilities. Feminist critiques highlight the need for diverse, nuanced characters and stories. Social media has created new platforms for feminist voices and activism. Hashtags and online campaigns raise awareness about gender-based violence and discrimination. However, digital spaces can also harbor harassment and backlash. The challenge is to create inclusive media ecosystems that amplify marginalized perspectives. Representation matters because it influences societal attitudes and self-identity. Changing the media landscape is a vital part of feminist work today.
