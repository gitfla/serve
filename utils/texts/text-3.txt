Economic inequality is a critical issue within feminist discourse. Women disproportionately experience wage gaps and job insecurity globally. Care work, often unpaid, is predominantly performed by women, reinforcing economic disparities. Structural barriers limit women’s access to leadership and entrepreneurial opportunities. Marginalized groups face compounded economic challenges due to intersecting identities. Feminist economists advocate for policies like paid family leave and affordable childcare. Addressing economic justice is essential for achieving true gender equality. Empowering women financially strengthens communities and reduces poverty. The feminist movement calls for systemic change in labor markets and social safety nets. Economic equity is not only a women’s issue but benefits society at large.
